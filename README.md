## Assignment

### Tech Stack Used - Firebase, NextJs, TailwindCss, Next-Auth

## Problem Statement - Create a Google Singup Singout system. Fetch a free Api and send data to Firebase.

## Approach

### So, For making a Singup Singout system I have used next-auth it will directly give us access to login with our google account we have to give the clientID and ClientSecret in GoogleProvider on next-auth then with the help of useSession, signIn, signOut we can easily achieve this functionality.

### For Fetching api I have used a free cat fact api which gives the fact about the cat I have used the traditional try and catch for fetching the api instead of axios.

### For sending data in server I have used firebase to send cat fact to backend which ever the user like so he can reach them again whenver he want to.

## Time taken to complete this assignment is 2.5 hours.
